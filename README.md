# JournalApp
<br/>(a)
<br/>Name of the project: Journal app
<br/>Names, ID and email:
<br/>-> Pranav Lekshminarayanan (2020AAPS1021G) - f20201021@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in
<br/>-> Garvit Arora (2020B2A72113G) - f20202113@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in
<br/>(b)
<br/>-> This app has a container in which you can fill all the Journal tasks you want to do or have done.
<br/>-> Clicking the plus floating action button adds a new Journal Entry.
<br/>-> There are also menu bar buttons like the info, delete and share button.
<br/>-> Closing the app does not affect the Journal Entries as it is stored in a database
<br/>-> Bugs : These are not really bugs but gives the user more freedom like user can add an empty journal entry and start time can be after end time.
<br/>(c)
<br/>-> Most of the tasks were done side by side using sir's videos on the persistent data, fragments and navigation components. The menu bar components were added with the help of android documentation.
<br/>-> Accessibility scanner gave some colour contrast errors which were fixed by adding darker colours. We also had to add a label to recycler view as it gave an issue that it didn't have a content description.
<br/>-> All the tasks given in the writeup are completed
<br/>-> The flow was completely followed by sir's videos step by step. But since, the app differs slightly changes were made so that start time and end time can be implemented.
<br/>-> The changes for the date, start time and end time was done using android studio documentation and a few geeks for geeks links.
<br/>-> Credits to sir's videos, android documentation and geeks for geeks.
<br/>(d)
<br/>-> The test in the test cases were made to check if all components in the program was working properly
<br/>-> Mostly espresso test cases were used to test the app. The app was crashing sometimes due to savedinstancebundles, so that was fixed using viewmodel.
<br/>-> The navigation test cases were already provided and the other accessibility test cases were added separately.
<br/>(e)
<br/>-> The assignment took about 30 hours
<br/>-> Copy pasting sir's code from slides took about 5 hours. The rest of the 25 hours were spent in making changes, learning and debugging.
<br/>(f)
<br/>-> This assignment would be a 9 as we felt the fragments part was rushed in the videos and database was a new concept. Some topics had to be explored separately for this assignment to work properly unlike previous ones.
